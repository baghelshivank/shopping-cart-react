This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Shopping Cart React

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using React. It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. The application is designed to demonstrate the use of React components, state management, and basic e-commerce functionality.

## Features

- Browse a list of products with their details such as name, price, and image.
- Add products to a shopping cart.
- View the contents of the shopping cart, including the total price.
- Increase or decrease the quantity of products in the cart.
- Remove products from the cart.
- Proceed to checkout, which currently simulates a successful purchase.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A library for routing and navigation in React applications.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the application.
- JavaScript: The programming language used for the application logic.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
  - `pages/`: Contains the main pages of the application.
  - `data/`: Contains the product data used in the application.
  - `App.js`: The main component that renders the application.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `public/`: Contains static assets and the HTML template for the application.
- `package.json`: Contains the project configuration and dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/baghelshivank/shopping-cart-react.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd shopping-cart-react`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
